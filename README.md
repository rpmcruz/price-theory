Economics games, inspired by David D. Friedman's

This project is to recreate the games designed by Dr Friedman and shipped with his Price Theory textbook: http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html. The original games were written in QBASIC and no longer run in modern computers.
