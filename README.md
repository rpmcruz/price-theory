Economics games, inspired by David D. Friedman's

This project is to recreate the games designed by [David D. Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman) and shipped with his [Price Theory textbook](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html). The original games were written [in QBASIC](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Living_Paper/living_paper.htm) and [no longer](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Living_Paper/Hansa/hansa_instructions/hansa_instructions.htm) run in modern computers.

The games are not meant to be playable for long, but to be a complement and motivate the textbook.

Possibly, the idea would be revamp the textbook, which is available online but presently featuring lacklustering and non-interactive graphics.

Current Progress:

2. [Hansa](https://rawgit.com/rpmcruz/price-theory/master/hansa/hansa.html)
3. [Supermarket](https://rawgit.com/rpmcruz/price-theory/master/supermarket/supermarket.html)
4. [Arbritrage](https://rawgit.com/rpmcruz/price-theory/master/arbritrage/arbritrage.html)
