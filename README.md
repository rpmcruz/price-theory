Economics games, inspired by David D. Friedman's

This project is to recreate the games designed by [David D. Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman) and shipped with his [Price Theory textbook](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html). The original games were written [in QBASIC](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Living_Paper/living_paper.htm) and no longer run in modern computers.

The games are not meant to be played for long, but to be complimentary and to motivate textbook use.

Possibly, the idea would be to revamp the textbook, which is available online but presently features lackluster, non-interactive graphics.

Current Progress:

2. [Hansa](https://rawgit.com/rpmcruz/price-theory/master/hansa/hansa.html)
3. [Supermarket](https://rawgit.com/rpmcruz/price-theory/master/supermarket/supermarket.html)
4. [Arbritrage](https://rawgit.com/rpmcruz/price-theory/master/arbritrage/arbritrage.html)
