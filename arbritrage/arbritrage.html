<h1>Arbritrage</h1>
<p>This game illustrates how people can make money on arbritage. This is a barter economy (no money), but you could easily see how this would work in the currency market for instance (where too there is no measure of account and so can be seen as a barter economy) or even the stockmarket. In the long run, this bidding of prices up and down regulates prices.</p>
